            <p>Ring Rolling is a metal forming process, which is used for rolling of rings. In this video, one can easily understand, how the ring rolling process is performed. The king in yellow color roll rolls over the ring which is shown in red against friction and the mandrel in green color exert pressure on opposite face, 
due to this the thickness of the ring continuously decreases and the diameter of the ring increases. The two conical rolls are placed axially to ensure that the width of the ring remains constant during the process. The shape of the ring can be made of different shapes by changing the surface of the king roll and the mandrel. 
In this video the ring is of curved surface. The image shows the initial and final condition of the ring. In the close up view one can clearly see the change in the shape of the ring, the change in mesh elements and position during the process.</p>
