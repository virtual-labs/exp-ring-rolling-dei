### Procedure


1. Start the ring rolling simulation or ensure that the ring rolling machine is properly set up and ready for operation.

2. Select the initial ring blank with given inner and outer diameters and suitable material.

3. Choose the type of ring rolling process to be performed, such as hot ring rolling or cold ring rolling.

4. Set the parameters of the king roll and mandrel, including roll diameter, rotational speed, and position.

5. Adjust the mandrel advance velocity to control the reduction in ring thickness.

6. Ensure that the axial or conical rolls are properly positioned to maintain a constant ring width.

7. Initiate the ring rolling process and allow the ring to rotate between the king roll and mandrel.

8. Observe the gradual reduction in cross-section and simultaneous increase in ring diameter during rolling.

9. Continue the rolling operation until the desired final dimensions of the ring are achieved.

10. Stop the process and record the final dimensions, surface finish, and any defects observed in the rolled ring.
